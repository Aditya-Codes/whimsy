This directory has two subdirectories...

1) "asf" contains the "model", i.e., a set of classes which encapsulate access
   to a number of data sources such as LDAP, ICLAs, auth lists, etc.

2) "www" contains the "view", largely a set of cgi scripts that produce HTML.
   Generally a cgi script is self contained, including all of the CSS,
   scripts, AJAX logic (client and server), SVG images, etc.  A single script
   may also produce a set (subtree) of web pages. 

If you want to run this remotely, the model code makes a few assumptions at the
moment:

1) current svn checkouts of various repositories are made (or linked to from)
   /home/whimsysvn/svn.

2) Access to LDAP requires a tunnel, configuration, and a cert.

   a) A tunnel can be created using the following (substitute your id):
      ssh -N -L 6636:minotaur.apache.org:636 rubys@minotaur.apache.org

   b) The model code determines what host and port to connect to by parsing
      /etc/ldap/ldap.conf for a line that looks like the following:
      uri     ldaps://localhost:6636

   c) A TLS_CACERT can be obtained via the following:

        ssh minotaur.apache.org openssl s_client -connect \
          minotaur.apache.org:636 -showcerts

      Copy from BEGIN to END inclusive into a file.  Point to the file in
      /etc/ldap/ldap.conf with a line like the following:

        TLS_CACERT      /etc/ldap/asf-ldap-client.pem

If you would like to understand how the view code works, you can get started
by looking at a few of the Wunderbar demos and README:
