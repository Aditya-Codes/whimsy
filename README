This directory contains a script that fetches and parsed secretary emails
and a server that will enable exploration of those emails.

Usage:

  rake fetch
  rake server

Notes:

  First fetch and parse will take approximately an hour, even with a relatively
  fast machine and internet connection.  Subsequent fetches will take as
  little as ten seconds or less.

  Secretary email archive currently requires about approximately 11 Gigabytes.
