This directory has two subdirectories...

1) "asf" contains the "model", i.e., a set of classes which encapsulate access
   to a number of data sources such as LDAP, ICLAs, auth lists, etc.

2) "www" contains the "view", largely a set of cgi scripts that produce HTML.
   Generally a cgi script is self contained, including all of the CSS,
   scripts, AJAX logic (client and server), SVG images, etc.  A single script
   may also produce a set (subtree) of web pages.
