*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

This initial commit merely roughs-in the configuration of a virtual machine
to run whimsy services.  The first service focused on is the secretarial
workbench.

Step 1: download or install Oracle VirtualBox

  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Step 2: download or install Vagrant

  http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Step 3: configure the virtual machine

  Making sure that you are in this directory as your working directory, enter:

    vagrant up

  Messages will scroll by.  Somewhere near the fourth from the last you will
  see a message like:

    Whimsy is available at http://192.168.1.165/whimsy

  Note the URL.

Step 4: check out foundation and documents

  In the same working directory, enter:

    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/tools/secretary
    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation --username=<yourid>
    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/documents --username=<yourid>
    exit

  Notes:

    a) vagrant ssh will also provide the whimsy URL for you.  This can be
       handy if you forgot it
    b) svn co will prompt you for your password, and ask you if you want to
       save it as plain text.  Doing so is likely necessary, but does mean
       that you will need to protect your machine from being accessed by
       others.

Step 5:

  Visit the URL, and click on "Secretary Workbench" (at the bottom)

-----

Todo:

1) Complete checkouts of foundation and documents are cumbersome, and will
   be destroyed if you ever decide to destroy the virtual machine.  It
   probably would be worth looking into allowing these directories to be 
   checked out under this directory as it is shared with the VM as /vagrant.
   Symbolic links could make this one copy appear wherever desired on both
   machines.

2) /var/tools/secretary/secmail.rb will need to be updated to use something
   other than sendmail as that isn't configured on this vagrant VM.  It will
   also need to be configured to select *your* from address and signature
   when run under vagrant ($USER == 'vagrant).

3) The workbench software is currently in "read only" mode in that it doesn't
   recognize the user 'vagrant' as being a secretary.
