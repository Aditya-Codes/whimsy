*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

This initial commit merely roughs-in the configuration of a virtual machine
to run whimsy services.  The first service focused on is the secretarial
workbench.

Step 1: download or install Oracle VirtualBox

  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Step 2: download or install Vagrant

  http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Step 3: configure the virtual machine

  Making sure that you are in this directory as your working directory, enter:

    USER=rubys vagrant up

  Change user to your id.  You can leave this part out entirely if your ASF
  id matches your current user id.

  Messages will scroll by.  Somewhere near the fourth from the last you will
  see a message like:

    Whimsy is available at http://192.168.1.165/whimsy

  Note the URL.

Step 4: (for use of the secretary workbench) check out foundation and documents

  In the same working directory, enter:

    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/tools/secretary
    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation --username=<yourid>
    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/documents --username=<yourid>
    exit

  Notes:

    a) vagrant ssh will also provide the whimsy URL for you.  This can be
       handy if you forgot it
    b) svn co will prompt you for your password, and ask you if you want to
       save it as plain text.  Doing so is likely necessary, but does mean
       that you will need to protect your machine from being accessed by
       others.

Step 5: (to use tools such as invoice):

  vagrant ssh
  bin/checkout-svn
  bin/get-cert
  bin/ldap-tunnel

  These will prompt you for things like your ASF password.

Step 6:

  Visit the URL, and click on the service you wish to use 

-----

Todo:

1) Complete checkouts of foundation and documents are cumbersome, and will
   be destroyed if you ever decide to destroy the virtual machine.  Should you
   happen to have a checkout of documents and foundation on your machine, and
   alternative version of step 4 is:

      mkdir svn
      *move* the documents and foundation trees into that directory
      vagrant ssh
      cd /var/tools/secretary
      ln -s /vagrant/svn/foundation
      ln -s /vagrant/svn/documents
      cd foundation
      svn update
      exit

   Note that it is important that you move the directories instead of merely
   symbolically linking to them, otherwise all the virtual machine will see is
   a symbolic link and not be able to get the data.  Of course you can add a
   symbolic link on the host machine from the old location to the current
   location.
