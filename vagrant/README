*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

This early prototype roughs-in the configuration of a virtual machine
to run whimsy services.
workbench.

Step 1: download or install Oracle VirtualBox

  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Step 2: download or install Vagrant

  http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Step 3: configure the virtual machine

  Making sure that you are in this directory as your working directory, enter:

    USER=rubys vagrant up

  Change user to your id.  You can leave this part out entirely if your ASF
  id matches your current user id.

  Messages will scroll by.  Somewhere near the fourth from the last you will
  see a message like:

    Whimsy is available at http://192.168.1.165/whimsy

  Note the URL.

Step 4a: (for use of the secretary workbench) check out foundation and documents

  In the same working directory, enter:

    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/tools/secretary
    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation --username=<yourid>
    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/documents --username=<yourid>
    exit

  Notes:

    a) vagrant ssh will also provide the whimsy URL for you.  This can be
       handy if you forgot it
    b) svn co will prompt you for your password, and ask you if you want to
       save it as plain text.  Doing so is likely necessary, but does mean
       that you will need to protect your machine from being accessed by
       others.

Step 4b: (to use tools such as invoice or committee/committer roster):

  vagrant ssh
  bin/checkout-svn
  bin/get-cert
  bin/ldap-tunnel

  These will prompt you for things like your ASF password.

Step 5:

  Visit the URL, and click on the service you wish to use 

-----

Todo:

1) Complete checkouts of foundation and documents are cumbersome, and will
   be destroyed if you ever decide to destroy the virtual machine.  Should you
   happen to have a checkout of documents and foundation on your machine, 
   this vagrant script will attempt to 'mount' the directory on /mnt/svn.
   With this in place, an alternative version of step 4a is:

      vagrant ssh
      cd /var/tools/secretary
      ln -s /mnt/svn/foundation
      ln -s /mnt/svn/documents
      cd foundation
      svn update
      exit

   Note: if the autodetection of the checkout for the foundation directory
   on your host machine isn't working, you can control the directory being
   mounted by setting the SVN_ROOT environment variable.
