This tool help file documents received via fax or email.

See HOWTO.html for usage.

General design of the tool:

*) configuration is done using local_paths.yml.  Format is a series of
   names followed by locations.  Most are directories where svn checkouts
   reside.  'mail' is a path to a ruby script that sets Mail.defaults as
   well as @from and @sig.

*) index.html splits the window into two panes using old-school frames.

*) worklist.cgi, worklist.css, and worklist.js are primarily responsible
   for the left pane.  This is mostly an HTML forms processing, with a lot
   of JavaScript to assist.

*) file.cgi is responsible for the right pane.  This is where most of the
   server logic resides, and mostly involves invoking underlying system
   commands (e.g., svn, pdftk, convert, gpg) and returning the results as
   HTML.

*) ccla.erb, grant.erb, icla.erb, mem.erb, and nda.erb are mail templates
   of confirmation replies sent back when the document is processed.

*) The tool assumes that the url /members/received is a symlink to a checkout
   of https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/documents/received
