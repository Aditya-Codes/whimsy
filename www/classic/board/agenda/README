This is an Angular.js application making use of Wunderbar in the production of
HTML and Ruby2JS in the production of JavaScript.

What this means is that there is Model, View, Controller, and Router logic
on the server, as well as Model, View, Controller, Router, and view helpers in
the form of Filers on the Client.

Additional server support logic can be found here:

https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/projects/whimsy/asf

Basic Roadmap:

  config.ru - integration with the web server (via Phusion Passenger)
  main.rb - server controller and router (using Sinatra)
  js - from a server perspective, more views.  From a client perspective:
    app_._js:     client controller and router
    filters._js:  client view helpers
    services._js: client model
    directives._js: client web components
  json - server side of form (or button) processing
  model - server side model
  partials - HTML fragments
  public - staticly served stylesheets
  views - common HTML layout

Touch 'tmp/restart.txt' whenever the app changes in order to restart the
server.
